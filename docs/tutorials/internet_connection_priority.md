# What is the priority of the Internet connection type?

The priority of 4 Internet connection type is

Cable > Repeater > Tethering > 3G/4G Modem

That means if the router has multiple type of connection simultaneously, it will choose the highest priority type connection, if the connection is down, it will fall back to a lower priority connection in a certain period of time.
