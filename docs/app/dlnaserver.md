# DLNA SERVER
Some of GL.iNet routers support DLNA Server, but this is not a default function. You need to install a little plug-ins to make it workable. 

Supporting List:
GL-AR750S-Ext, GL-AR750, GL-MT300N-V2, GL-AR300M series, GL-AR150 series, GL-MiFi and GL-X750

## Install Plug-ins 
Go to **APPLICATIONS**, then Plug-ins.
Install two apps:

1. luci-app-minidlna
2. miniDLNA

## Use the DLNA server in GL.iNet Routers
After Installation of two applications, you can now use your GL.iNet router as as DLNA server. 

1. Make suer you already has a TF card inserted into the card slot before you power up your router. *Hot-plug* is not supported on GL.iNET routers. 
2. Or you can insert an USB drive into the USB port. 
3. Connnet your PC, Laptop, tablet, smart TV or Smartphone to GL.iNET router's WiFi(SSID). Here is the sample: GL-AR750-xxx 
4. Then you can find the **OpenWrt DLNA Server** in your devices.
