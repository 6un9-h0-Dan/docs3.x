## DDNS

**Dynamic Domain Name Service (DDNS)** is a service used to map a domain name to the dynamic IP address of a network device. 

You can remotely access your router with a url though this function. Example: myRouterDeviceID.glddns.com

In version 3.021 or above it is a default function, in other 3.0 version you need to install packages using Plug-ins.
