# Wireless Settings

You can check the status and configure the wireless network created by your router.

Go to `WIRELESS` to find the wireless settings.

A router may have one or more radio and one device can have multiple Virtual interfaces.

In this example, the channel of the wireless network is **36** and tx power is **20**. We have two AP interfaces with SSID **GL-AR750-746-5G** and **GL-AR750-746**. You can turn on of off the wireless signal by clicking the the On/Off button.

## Wireless Settings

Click the `Modify` to change the settings of the wireless network:

**Wi-Fi Name (SSID)**: Change the name of the Wi-Fi. It is not suggested to use unicode characters such as **Chinese**.

**Wi-Fi Key**: It must be at least 8 characters. We suggest you to change the Wi-Fi password when you get the router.

**Channel**: The router will not choose the best channel itself. You need to choose a channel manually. If your router is used as a Wi-Fi repeater, the channel will be fixed according to the connected network.

**Mode**: For 5GHz wireless network, the speed is fixed to 433Mbps. For 2.4GHz wireless network, there are 11Mbps, 54Mbps, 150Mbps or even 300Mbps.

**TX Power (dBm)**: It specifies the signal strength. The default value is 20 (Strongest).
