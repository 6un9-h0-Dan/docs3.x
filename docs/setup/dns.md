# Custom DNS Server

You can set up custom DNS server for the router in order to prevent DNS leak or other purposes.

Please go to `MORE SETTINGS` > `Custom DNS Server`, enable `Manual DNS Server Settings` so that you can input maximum two DNS servers.

Check `Override DNS Settings for All clients` will capture the DNS request from all connected clients. For example Google Chrome cast. This option does not need to be used with custom DNS server.

You can also check `DNS over TLS from cloudflare` so as to adopt the public DNS service from Cloudflare directly.

*Note: You may need to reconnect the network in order to activate your DNS settings.*
