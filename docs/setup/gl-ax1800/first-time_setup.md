*Note: If your browser always redirects to LuCI (http://192.168.8.1/cgi-bin/luci), you can  visit: [http://192.168.8.1/index](http://192.168.8.1/index) instead of [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1).*

### Admin Password Setting

There is no default password for the Admin Panel. You have to set your own password, which must be at least 5 characters. Then, click `Submit` to proceed.
