**Wi-Fi Name (SSID)**: The name of the Wi-Fi. It is not suggested to use unicode characters such as **Chinese**.

**Wi-Fi Security**: The encryption method of the Wi-Fi.

**Wi-Fi Key**: The password of the Wi-Fi, which must be at least 6 characters. We suggest you to change it when you receive the router.

**SSID Visibility**: Show or hide the SSID.

**Wi-Fi Mode**: Choose the IEEE standard for WLANs.

**Bandwidth**: The width of channel.

**Channel**: The router will not choose the best channel itself. You need to choose a channel manually. If your router is used as a Wi-Fi repeater, the channel will be fixed according to the connected wireless network.

**Speed**: The wireless speed of the router.

**TX Power (dBm)**: It specifies the signal strength.

Click `Modify` to change the settings of the wireless network.

## Guest Wi-Fi

Guest Wi-Fi is turned off by default, you can turn on it for visitors. Guest Wi-Fi is separated from the default Wi-Fi. That is, you can only access the Internet in Guest Wi-Fi, not the web Admin Panel.
