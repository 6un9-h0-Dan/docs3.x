# MAC Clone 

Clone MAC address is used especially in hotels, hotspot etc when the server checks your mac address. For example, if you got your smartphone registered on the network, you can clone your smartphone's mac address to the router so that the router can also connect to the network.

Go to `MORE SETTINGS` > `MAC Clone`, choose the MAC address of your current client for your router (WAN) and click `Apply`.
