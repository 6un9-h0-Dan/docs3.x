# LAN IP Setting

LAN IP is the IP address you will use to connect to this router. If it conflicts with your main router, you can change it in Admin Panel.



## Default LAN IP
The default IP address of GL.iNet router is 192.168.8.1. 

## Change LAN IP
Most of the routers use IP `192.168.0.1`, `192.168.1,1`, `192.168.1.254`, `10.10.1.1` etc. If you want to connect GL.iNet router to another network, you have to ensure they have different IP address. If not, you need to change the LAN IP of GL.iNet routers.

Click the `LAN IP` under the drop down mene of `MORE SETTINGS`. Then change the LAN IP and click `Apply`.
