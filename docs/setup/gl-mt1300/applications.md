## IGMP Snooping

You can enable _**IGMP snooping**_ to use the multicast functions on the router. 

_**IGMP Snooping**_ listens to the IGMP protocol package, extracts the corresponding information, establishes and maintains the layer 2 multicast forwarding publication, and then forwards the multicast group data to the host that joins the multicast group, while other hosts cannot receive the multicast group data.

_**IGMP V3**_ is compatible with _**v1**_ and _**v2**_, you can try _**v3**_ first and change it if you find any problem.
